# This is the repository of Alan's custom typeface


### Important notes
- This is a **work in progress** and your opinion matters. Please share as much feedback as you can. Test the fonts in the context of your work, send us screenshots, share thoughts. 
- Until the typeface is published, the font files are confidential. **Never share them, even with other Alaners** = we don’t want “corrupted” or unfinished fonts to spread across our servers. This is a nightmare to fix (been there).
- More of an advice: never install the font files using the Mac font book manager (it’s not made to support frequent install/uninstall, this could damage your computer), prefer tools like [FontBase](https://fontba.se/). 
- Tip: if you sync this repo with your computer (“clone” in GH slang) and then tell Fontbase to always look in the cloned folder, you won’t have to install-uninstall at each new version. Just “Pull” the latest updates from Github, and it will update automatically.
